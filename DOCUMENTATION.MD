# Structural Overview

Godot 4.4 allows for Modular programming that this project takes advantage of. By seperating the program into seperate slices, code has been easier to read and understand. Heavenly Havoc relies on emiting and recieving signals across different scenes in order to form a more cohesive game. 
The bulk of these are defined in an auto-loade global script found in `global.gd`, which, indicated by its namesake provides global variables and signals which scripts can reference and pass along.
